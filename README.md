**3. Uploading and Viewing:**

- Commit the `portfolio.md` file to your Jekyll project's repository on GitHub.
- Build and deploy your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages as per the theme's instructions.
- Access your deployed portfolio through your GitHub Pages URL.

**Customization:**

- The Cayman theme may offer options in its configuration file (`_config.yml`) to control font sizes, colors, and some layout elements. Refer to the theme's documentation for details.

By following these steps, you can create a Readme file for your portfolio using Jekyll theme-Cayman. Although it won't have the same visual layout as a custom HTML/CSS approach, it allows for a well-structured Markdown document that showcases your information and projects.
